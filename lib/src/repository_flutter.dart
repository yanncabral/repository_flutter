/// A widget that builds itself based on the latest state of a repository.
///
/// This widget rebuilds itself whenever the repository changes, and it
/// rebuilds its child whenever the data in the repository changes.
///
/// This widget is useful for fetching data from a repository and building a
/// widget tree based on the data.
///
/// To use this widget, you must provide a repository and a builder function.
/// The builder function is called whenever the repository changes. It is
/// passed the latest data from the repository, and it must return a widget.
///
/// If the repository is not ready, the builder function is called with a null
/// data value. This can happen when the repository has not yet fetched any
/// data, or when the repository is in an error state.
///
/// The following example shows how you might use this widget to build a list
/// of items:
///
/// ```dart
/// RepositoryBuilder<List<Item>>(
///   repository: itemRepository,
///   builder: (context, items) {
///     if (items == null) {
///      return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
///    } else {
///     return ListView(
///       children: [
///         for (var item in items)
///           ListTile(
///             title: Text(item.name),
///             subtitle: Text(item.description),
///           ),
///       ],
///     );
///   },
/// );
/// ```
